Firewalld has caused me problems

"Error: INVALID_ZONE" when trying to modify firewall rules... fedora server has no default zone? Or did I do this to myself by trying to rename interfaces?
The default on a newly written sd card is FedoraServer, so maybe this is not going to be a problem going forward.

also if I disable firewalld on both client and server, TFTP works.
But it doesn't work if EITHER has it enabled.
(this is after i disabled ipv6)
(although i still see ipv6-to-4 addresses in syslog sometimes, no fucking idea why)
